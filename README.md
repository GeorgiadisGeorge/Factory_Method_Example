# Factory_Method_Example

Flow and Process:

1 We start by defining the IVehicle interface with properties and a Drive method that all vehicle classes must implement.


2 We then define three classes (Car, Truck, and Motorcycle) that implement the IVehicle interface and contain their own unique implementation of the Drive method.


3 Next, we define the IVehicleFactory interface with a CreateVehicle method that returns an IVehicle object.


4 We then create three classes (CarFactory, TruckFactory, and MotorcycleFactory) that implement the IVehicleFactory interface and create instances of their respective vehicle classes.


5 Finally, in our Main method, we create instances of the vehicle factories and use them to create instances of the vehicle classes, which we then drive and display their properties.



Advantages:

1 The Factory Method pattern allows for the creation of objects to be decoupled from the code that uses those objects. This improves the maintainability and flexibility   of the code, as changes to the creation process can be made without affecting the code that uses the objects.


2 The pattern allows for different implementations of the same interface to be used interchangeably. This is useful when the behavior of an object needs to be determined   at runtime based on user input or other factors.


3 The pattern promotes encapsulation and abstraction, making the code more modular and easier to test.


Disadvantages:

1 The pattern can add complexity to the code, especially for simple cases where a direct instantiation of the object would suffice.


2 The pattern can lead to an overabundance of small classes, making the codebase harder to navigate and understand.


3 The pattern may not be useful in cases where the creation of objects is not a primary concern. In these cases, other patterns such as the Singleton or Builder patterns   may be more appropriate.





Overall, the Factory Method pattern is a powerful tool for managing the creation of objects in an application. While it does come with some disadvantages, its advantages in terms of maintainability, flexibility, and modularity make it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.
